				<h1>Voxilent</h1>
				<p>To get started in game development I had to start simple and there’s not much simpler than a clicker.</p>
				<p>The idea was cookie clicker with many different resources to click (wood, stone etc.) 
					then once you had, say, 8 stone a furnace resource would appear with a visible connection to the stone resource. 
					Clicking on the furnace would remove 8 stone and give you one furnace. So, it’s a clicker with a slight complexity leap. 
					And that’s how it started...</p>

				<p>But with passion and optimism comes hubris.</p>
				
				<div class="image"><img src="images\voxilent\menus.gif" alt="" /></div>
				<div class="image"><img src="images\voxilent\process.gif" alt="" /></div>

				<p>A new feature &trade;! "I know! How about instead of these resources already being present on the screen, 
					you must place them in a grid and draw the connections between them yourself?". 
					That certainly sounds more involved than your average clicker, but perhaps a good question would have been, “what value does this bring?”. 
					Of course, that question didn’t cross my mind, a <i>genius</i> game design awaited, and reason be damned! 
					About 16 similar features later and I had a factory building sim with upgrades, research-tree, strategy, and a spiffy plot to boot. 
					I say 'had', what i really mean is I had to make that. To the surprise of absolutely no one, the game sits half-finished, collecting dust.</p>

				<div class="image"><img src="images\voxilent\upgrade.gif" alt="" /></div>

				<p>What I learnt; it goes without saying, plan out your solution before implementation, and secondly, 
					find a method of coding solutions in a way that doesn’t result in spaghetti. Spaghetti? yes. 
					A brief glace at the code for voxilent reveals a superb LACK of 'consistent structure', or as they are more commonly known, <b>design patterns</b>&trade;.</p>
				
				<p>Looking back now, I cringe at the horrific self-referential code, with overly dense classes created to solve less problems than they ended up causing, 
					and nary a comment explaining any of this mess in sight. The lessons however, I would cherish,
					and after abandoning this mountainous task of a game the next project would surely be better.</p>
